**Title:** Implement Decentralized Trading Feature for USDT on Bybit vs ADA on Native Wallet

**Description:** As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to be able to trade USDT (Tether USD) on Bybit against ADA (Cardano) stored in my native wallet using a constant product algorithm. This feature will enable me to leverage the best of both worlds: the liquidity of Bybit for USDT and the security of my native wallet for ADA.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **Connectivity**: Establish a secure connection to Bybit API for USDT trading and integrate with the native wallet for ADA storage.
2. **Constant Product Algorithm**: Implement the constant product algorithm to determine the optimal trading price for USDT and ADA based on market conditions.
3. **Order Management**: Create, manage, and execute trades (limit orders and market orders) for USDT on Bybit and ADA on native wallet.
4. **Real-time Price Updates**: Fetch and update prices for USDT and ADA in real-time to ensure accurate trading decisions.
5. **Trade Execution**: Execute trades instantly, considering the constant product algorithm, order types, and market conditions.
6. **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect user's ADA funds stored in the native wallet and USDT funds on Bybit.
7. **User Interface**: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface to display trading data, order book, and trade history.
8. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to handle API errors, connection issues, and other unexpected events.

**User Journey:**

1. **Setup**: User sets up their Bybit API keys and native wallet for ADA storage.
2. **Dashboard**: User accesses the trading dashboard, which displays the current prices of USDT and ADA, order book, and trade history.
3. **Order Creation**: User creates a trade order (limit or market) for USDT on Bybit and ADA on native wallet.
4. **Order Execution**: The system executes the trade using the constant product algorithm and real-time prices.
5. **Trade Management**: User monitors and manages their trades, with the option to cancel or modify orders.

**Dependencies:**

* Bybit API for USDT trading
* Native wallet for ADA storage (e.g., Daedalus, Yoroi)
* Web3 libraries for blockchain interactions
* Front-end framework for UI development (e.g., React, Angular)

**Assumptions and Preconditions:**

* User has a Bybit account and native wallet for ADA storage.
* User has basic knowledge of cryptocurrency trading and blockchain technology.
* The system will be built on top of existing infrastructure and APIs.

**Success Metrics:**

* Successful execution of trades using the constant product algorithm.
* User adoption and engagement with the feature.
* Positive user feedback on the feature's performance and usability.

**Risks and Challenges:**

* Integration challenges with Bybit API and native wallet.
* Security risks associated with handling user funds and API keys.
* Complexity of implementing the constant product algorithm.

**Prioritization:**

This feature is a high priority, as it enables users to trade USDT on Bybit against ADA on native wallet using a constant product algorithm, providing a unique value proposition for cryptocurrency traders.
